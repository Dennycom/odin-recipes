### HTML Tutorial Project
This project is a culmination of all that I have learned from the start of this course up to this point.
This will include
introduction to computers, 
introduction to web development, 
downloading, installing and configuring linux, 
introduction to using linux as well as basic commands on terminal. 
It will also test my knowledge of Git and github as well as html as the basic foundation on which web pages are built.
